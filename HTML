This file contains all the main HTML and JavaScript Files. 
This also Contains the required resources/additional files/supporting files , required to run the main HTML files, 
They include .jpeg(IMAGE FILES), .mp4(VIDEO FILES), .mp3(AUDIO FILES).

(IMPORTANT) *----------DO NOT CHANGE THE NAMES OF THE SUPPORTING FILES----------*

If you wish to change the names of the supporting files, make sure that you edit the
required codes in the primary HTML files. (eg - HTML pages with images, have an attribute
in HTML tag 'img',known as the 'src', which refers to the source of the file, and this is
where the path of the img file will be stored. So, you must edit this path as it will contain
the old file name. If not done, it will cause an error and the images won't show up on the webpage.

Thank You.
